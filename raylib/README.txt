raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.

to start coding games/graphics/tools with raylib in a few seconds.

raylib Windows installer package installs raylib by default in: C:\raylib 
Directory is self-contained and portable, including all required tools:

 - raylib 5.0 library with source code, examples and several preconfigured projects
 - Notepad++ 8.5.8 (npp) preconfigured with some scripts to compile raylib and examples
 - Portable C and C++ Development Kit for x64 Windows (https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit)
     - w64devkit 1.20.0 contains multiple tools and MinGW-w64 with GCC 13.2.0 (64bit)

A "Notepad++ for raylib" shortcut is created on desktop and once the program is open, 
it opens raylib.h header file, for API reference, and core_basic_window.c example. 

Pressing F6 should open NppExec script system to compile and run the example.
